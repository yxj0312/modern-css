                ```

        ```php

    - avatar can be cached and searched
    - own filter: will be avaiable by all tables and search
        - have CLI generator for it
    - lenses: similar to filter, but more a radical way of looking at a resource
        - i.e. a lense called most valuable users
          ```php
          public static function query(LensRequest $request, $query)
          {
              return $request->withOrdering($request->withFilters(
                query->select('users.id', 'users.name', 
                        DB::raw('sum(licenses.price) as revenue'))
                    ->join('licenses', 'users.id', '=', 'licenses.user_id')
                    ->orderBy('revenue', 'desc')
                    ->groupBy('users.id', 'users.name')
              ));
          }
          ```
          click this will jump to a new view of users
          and filter is still reused, attach all the filter
    - actions: i.e a new action: deactivate
        ```php
        <!-- in User -->
        public function actions(Request $request)
        {
            return [
                new Actions\Deactivate,
            ]
        }
        ```
        - not only for tables, but also for single user
        - actionable trait for indication all your actions
        - can also attach to pivot table

            -- Play WOW all the day and already 120 --
    - helper function: referToPivotAs()
